# 90DaysOfDevOpsChallenge
🌟 Week 1 of hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps2025 – Networking Challenge Completed🌟
The first week of my DevOps learning journey focused on Networking, one of the core pillars of DevOps. Here’s what I covered:
🔍 What I Learned & Practiced:
✅ OSI & TCP/IP Models – Understanding how data flows across networks and where different protocols fit in. I mapped real-world examples to each layer (like how HTTP operates at the Application Layer and TCP ensures reliable transport).
✅ Networking Protocols & Ports – Explored commonly used protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, DNS, and FTP, along with their port numbers and significance in DevOps workflows.
✅ AWS EC2 & Security Groups – Launched an EC2 instance and configured Security Groups to allow and restrict traffic based on rules. It was great to see how cloud networking plays a crucial role in securing infrastructure.
✅ Essential Networking Commands – Practiced ping, traceroute, netstat, curl, dig, and nslookup to diagnose network connectivity and troubleshoot issues.

This was a great start to the challenge! Excited to dive deeper into DevOps in the coming weeks.
