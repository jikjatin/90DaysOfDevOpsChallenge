# Week 5: Docker Basics & Advanced Challenge

Welcome to the **Week 5 Docker Challenge!** This repository showcases the completion of all tasks in the challenge. Below are the completed tasks along with their descriptions, commands used, and screenshots.

## Task 1: Introduction and Conceptual Understanding

Introduction to Docker
Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers, ensuring consistency across different environments.

Virtualization vs. Containerization
Feature	Virtualization	Containerization
Architecture	Uses a hypervisor to create VMs	Uses a container runtime (e.g., Docker)
Performance	Higher overhead due to full OS	Lightweight, shares the host OS kernel
Boot Time	Slow (minutes)	Fast (seconds)
Resource Usage	Requires more CPU & RAM	Efficient resource utilization
Isolation	Stronger (separate OS per VM)	Process-level isolation
Why Containerization is Preferred for Microservices & CI/CD?
Lightweight & Fast - Containers start quickly and consume fewer resources compared to VMs.

Consistency Across Environments - Ensures that applications run the same way in development, testing, and production.

Scalability - Containers allow for efficient scaling and orchestration using tools like Kubernetes.

Microservices Support - Ideal for breaking applications into smaller, independent services.

CI/CD Integration - Easily integrates with CI/CD pipelines for faster deployment and rollback.
