# Week 5: Docker Basics & Advanced Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the Week 5 Docker Challenge. Throughout this challenge, I explored Docker fundamentals, built containerized applications, optimized images, and configured Docker networking. Below are the tasks I have completed.

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Introduction and Conceptual Understanding
- Learned the purpose of Docker in DevOps.
- Compared Virtualization vs. Containerization.
